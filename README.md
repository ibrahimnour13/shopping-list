This is a simple example of a 3 tier application: Shopping List

It is a web app that allows you to create and remove shopping lists, and add and remove items from this list.

Actions taken in the frontend send an HTTP request to the backend. The backend interacts with the DB to perform the desired action.

Technologies:
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
    Backend: PHP
    DB: MySQL
